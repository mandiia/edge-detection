# edge-detection
Edge detection using Sobel operator 
In the repository, there are included three .h files (check_file, sobel_kernel and sobel_operator) and one .c file (main). 
In the sobel_kernel.h file we have defined the kernel of the Sobel operator whick is being used.
In the check_file.h we are making sure that the image we are working with is in 8-bit grayscale format.
And in the sobel_operator.h file
